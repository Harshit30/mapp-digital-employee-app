# mapp-digital-employee-app
This app provides the functionality to list/add/edit and delete employees.

For now this uses only the local state with a single unit test created using Jest and Enzyme.

Once you clone the app: 

Go to mapp-digital-employee-app\mapp-digital-employee-app

Run npm install

Run npm start

This should launch the app using a local webpack dev server at localhost:3000
